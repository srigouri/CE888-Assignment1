# Causal Inference on IHDP and Jobs datasets.

This repository holds a file containing python code for Causal Inference model on two different datasets.
Regression model on IHDP dataset which is to estimate the cognitive score of infants which depends on various features like child birth weight,head circumference, weeks born preterm, birth order, first born, neonatal health index, sex and information about the mother at the time she gave birth like age, marital status, educational attainment, whether she worked or not and her behaviours during the pregnancy whether she smoked cigarettes, drank alcohol,took drugs etc.The treatment that we are estimating is the effect of family support on cognitive score.

Logistic Regression model on Jobs dataset which is to check how the employment status of people depends on job training from NSWP.In this case,the outcome is binary variable.
